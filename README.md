# MQTT to IR Bridge for Air Conditioner Control in Home Assistant

## ðŸ“‹ Description

This project enables air conditioner control in Home Assistant using an infrared (IR) remote added to a Zigbee2MQTT setup.  
The application publishes discovery messages to Home Assistant, subscribes to MQTT topics for air conditioner commands, and posts corresponding IR commands to a Zigbee2MQTT topic. A Zigbee IR remote is responsible for sending the actual IR signals to the air conditioner.

## ðŸ§© Flow Diagram
The system flow is represented below, showing how the data moves between components:
```
    [Home Assistant]
(Sends "Turn on AC" message)
           â†“
      [MQTT Broker]
           â†“
         [App]
 (Converts message and
  publishes IR commands)
           â†“
      [MQTT Broker]
           â†“
      [Zigbee2MQTT]
(Sends IR signals via Zigbee)
           â†“
    [IR-Controlled AC]
```
